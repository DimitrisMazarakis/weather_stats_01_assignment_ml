    "\n",
    "* Data downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Environmental Information (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/) and in particular https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search. \n",

The gray line in the middle is the average percentage of extreme tempearture events of the baseline.

Then, by dividing the rainfall by the number of rainy days you will get an indication of whether we are getting rain in more concentrated bursts.

You may seek help on the Internet, by Googling or searching in StackOverflow for general questions pertaining to the use of Python,  libraries, and idioms. However, it is not right to ask direct questions that relate to the assignment and where people will actually solve your problem by answering them. You may discuss with your fellow students in order to better understand the questions, if they are not clear enough, but you should not ask them to share their answers with you, or to help you by giving specific advice."
